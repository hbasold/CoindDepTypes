# Partial formalisation of a type theory based on mixed inductive-coinductive dependent types

The code in this repository is a formalisation of parts of the work in [1].
More precisely, we formalised the raw syntax and the reduction relation, which
were given in that paper.

In the future, I would like to have at least the typing rules and the proof of
subject reduction formalised.

# Usage

Requires Agda version 2.6.0.1 and the master branch of the standard library (will be v0.18).
